/// Unsafe marker trait for serialisable types
///
/// A type is serialisable if it can be represented as a type compatible with
/// one in C++ and if it can be copied  across task boundaries safely. Primitive
/// types such as bool or u32 are `Serialisable`, complex types need to the
/// [Serialiser](trait.Serialiser.html) trait.
pub unsafe trait Serialisable: Clone {}

/// (De)serialisation for complex data types
///
/// This trait serves both as a serialisation and dispatcher trait. It marks a
/// type as being serialisable in its layout to the message registers and
/// readable again. Since this procedure needs to be repeatable on the C++ side
/// as well, great care has been taken. This is usually safe for primitive
/// types, a few types from this framework and for structs with a C ABI.
///
/// The UTCB is accessed through the [`ArgAccesss<T>`](struct.ArgAccess.T.html).
/// The implementor may choose to use the default implementation which
/// transmutes the message registers at the next free and already correctly
/// aligned location and copies the data of `Self` to it. The implementor may
/// choose to override this behaviour, i.e. by using the `write_items` function
/// of the message registers, by doing internal accounting or by using the
/// kernel buffer store (if capabilities are being transfered), etc. This
/// description applies both for reading and writing. For examples of
/// implementors, see the Flex Page and Cap(ability) types.
